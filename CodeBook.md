## The variables
* "group": 70% of the subjects are in "Train" group, 30% in "Test" group
* "activites": each subject performed 6 different activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING)
* "subjects": 30 subjects in the study labeled as 1 - 30

* variables in column 4 - 69: 
* prefix 't' to denote time
* prefix 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals produced by Fast Fourier Transform
* 'body': body signals
* 'gravity': gravity signals
* 'acc': data collected from the accelerometer
* 'gyro': data collected from the gyroscope
* 'jerk': body linear acceleration and angular velocity
* 'mag': magnitude of the signals calculated using the Euclidean norm
* 'mean': average value
* 'std': standard deviation
* 'x/y/z': 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions
